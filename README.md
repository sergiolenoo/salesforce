# Welcome

This is my portfolio repository! This project is currently under construction and will be updated regularly. Here, I aim to showcase my skills with Salesforce, along with my understanding of programming best practices and principles.

All the necessary metadata, including labels and custom metadata / records required for the code to work, is also available in this repository.

Take a look at the class `ZipCodeAddressOutboundService` for a demonstration of REST integration. This class retrieves address details for both Brazilian and German zip codes.
